When the seed first begins to form it is tiny and soft and delicate. It
is attached to the inside of the ovary, and we do not then call it a
seed, but an ovule. The word “ovule” means “little egg,” and the ovules
are really the eggs of the plant, as you will agree if you think a
moment.

If all goes well, the tiny, soft ovule becomes a large, hard seed. But
it cannot do this alone; it needs help. Probably you never could guess
what helps it, so I will tell you at once: it is the pollen.

If a pollen grain can unite with an ovule, the two thus joined together
can grow into a seed. So you see the flower does not provide pollen for
the use of the bee alone. It makes it for its own seed-children.

But the bee is the messenger that carries the pollen to the ovule. You
see the pollen grain of our morning-glory lies in the anther below the
stigma, and it must reach the stigma so as to find its way down to the
ovary. Just how all this comes about you will know later; only now
remember that the pollen must get to the stigma, and that the bee puts
it there. Not on purpose, though. The bee collects pollen for her own
use, but in doing so touches the stigma with her pollen-covered body,
and some of the pollen grains stick to the stigma instead of remaining
on the bee.
